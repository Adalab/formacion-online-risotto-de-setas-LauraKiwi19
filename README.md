# Shopping List

This is an exercise made for the online formation of Adalab. It's a **shopping list** which gets its info from an API and shows the ingredients of a recipe (in this case it's a mushroom risotto), their price, brand and amount needed. You can pick some of them, all or any, and the total price will change.
